Each round adds newly measured activity or stability to the data and updates the candidate ranking.</p>

<h3>New approaches to foundation models</h3><p>AMix-1 models proteins with Bayesian flow networks and explores conditioning on multiple sequence alignments and inference-time search. AMix-2 unifies protein and text modeling, using causal generation between blocks and diffusion within each block. When reading, trace the roles of conditioning inputs, candidate generation, and verifiers separately.</p>

## Turn an interdisciplinary question into a small project

Once you have a question, connect the data, model and validation in a complete research workflow.

1. **Define the object of study.** Is one sample a sequence, a patient, a cell or a market at a particular time? How is the target measured, and in what units?
2. **Preserve the structure of the domain.** Molecules have symmetries, graphs have relationships, time series have an order, and medical images have voxel spacing. Which information do the representation, model and loss preserve?
3. **Decide what new conditions matter.** New molecular scaffolds, protein families, donors, participants, patients and future periods call for different data splits.
4. **Establish a reference and analyse changes.** Compare simple methods with the new model and locate its errors. Connect candidate designs to further calculations or experiments, recording how each result changes the next step.

For time-series foundations, [Forecasting: Principles and Practice](https://otexts.com/fpp3/) covers trends, forecasting and evaluation with examples in R. For Python projects, see [tsai](https://github.com/timeseriesAI/tsai).
